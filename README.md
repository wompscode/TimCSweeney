Joke Discord-bot for friend server. Reacts with emojis specific to message content.  
~~No support will be provided if you want to use it.~~  
I'll probably try to make it easier to work with eventually, but for now - you're still not really going to get any kind of support.  
  
Image detection isn't particularly great, but for the extent of the joke - it works! I don't care nearly enough.
  
uses EmguCV, Tesseract and Discord.NET :)  
for Tesseract under Linux, there are x64 compiled natives, but anything that isn't x64 is SOL and you will need to compile these natives (or find precompiled versions that match the exact versions required)  
for EmguCV under Linux, you will need to follow the dependencies they request for it.
